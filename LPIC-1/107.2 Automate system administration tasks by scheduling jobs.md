# 107.2 Automate System Administration Tasks by Scheduling Jobs

System administrators should be able to schedule recurring tasks using `cron` and `systemd` timers, and schedule one-time tasks using `at`.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Manage `cron` and `at` jobs.
- Configure user access to `cron` and `at` services.
- Understand `systemd` timer units.

## Important Files and Commands

### Cron Directories & Files
- `/etc/cron.{d,daily,hourly,monthly,weekly}/` – System-wide cron jobs.
- `/etc/crontab` – Global cron file.
- `/var/spool/cron/` – User-specific cron jobs.
- `/etc/cron.allow`, `/etc/cron.deny` – Control user access to cron (by default, these files may not exist and should be created if needed) (like wite list and black list).

### at Files
- `/etc/at.allow`, `/etc/at.deny` – Control user access to `at` (by default, these files may not exist and should be created if needed) (like wite list and black list).

### Commands
- `crontab -l` – List user cron jobs.
- `crontab -e` – Edit user cron jobs.
- `at [time]` – Schedule a one-time job.
- `atq` – Show pending `at` jobs.
- `atrm [job_id]` – Remove an `at` job.
- `systemctl list-timers` – List (only) active `systemd` timers (to see all timers, use `systemctl list-timers --all`).
- `systemd-run --on-calendar="hourly" myscript.sh` – Run a command with `systemd` timer (similar to `at` for running a command once).

## Crontab Format
Each crontab line consists of 6 fields:
```text
A    B    C    D    E    command and arguments
```

| Field | Meaning        | Values                          |
|-------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| A     | Minute       | 0-59                            |
| B     | Hour         | 0-23                            |
| C     | Day of Month | 1-31                            |
| D     | Month        | 1-12 (or names)                 |
| E     | Day of Week  | 0-7 (0/7 = Sunday, or names)    |

### Special Keywords
- `@reboot` – Run after reboot.
- `@daily` – Run once a day.
- `@weekly` – Run once a week.
- `@monthly` – Run once a month.

### Examples
```bash
5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job >> $HOME/tmp/out 2>&1   # Run at 00:05 every day; output and errors are redirected to $HOME/tmp/out
15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly  # Run at 14:15 on the 1st of every month
0 22 * * 1-5    echo "It's 10 PM"   # Run at 22:00 on weekdays
*/5 * * * *     echo "Every 5 min"  # Run every 5 minutes
42 8,18 * * 1-5 echo "Twice a day"  # Run at 08:42 and 18:42 on weekdays
@reboot         echo "System restarted" # Run after system reboot
@daily          echo "Daily job"  # Run once a day
```

## User-Specific Cron Jobs
Each user has their own cron jobs stored in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/`.
To edit, use:
```sh
crontab -e
```
This command ensures syntax validation and warns about mistakes. Although the file can be edited manually, using `crontab -e` is recommended.

## System-Wide Cron Jobs
Located in `/etc/crontab`:
```text
A    B    C    D    E    USER    command and arguments
```
This format allows specifying the user under which the command should run.

Example:
```text
*/15 * * * *   root   /usr/lib/cron/run-crons >/dev/null 2>&1
```
System cron jobs can also be placed in:
- `/etc/cron.hourly/`
- `/etc/cron.daily/`
- `/etc/cron.weekly/`
- `/etc/cron.monthly/`

Scripts placed in these directories execute at their respective intervals. Ensure they have executable permissions.

## `at` – One-Time Jobs
Use `at` for one-time scheduled tasks. In newer Linux distributions, `at` may not be installed by default and requires manual installation and enabling of its service.

### Schedule a Job
```sh
at 14:00
# Type command, then press Ctrl+D
```
Example:
```sh
at now + 3 min
warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
at Mon Feb 17 17:21:00 2025
at> touch /tmp/newfile_by_at
at> <EOT>
job 1 at Mon Feb 17 17:21:00 2025
```

### List Pending Jobs
```sh
atq
```
Example:
```sh
atq
1	Mon Feb 17 17:21:00 2025 a root
```

### Remove a Job
```sh
atrm [job_id]
```
Example:
```sh
atrm 1
```

## systemd & systemd-run  

Most modern Linux distributions use `systemd`, which provides **timers** as an alternative to cron for scheduling tasks. Timers are defined in `.timer` unit files and typically activate a corresponding `.service` unit with the same name.  

### Timer Types  

1. **Real-time timers** (like cron) use `OnCalendar=` with a syntax similar to:  
   ```
   OnCalendar=DayOfWeek Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second
   ```
   Example: Run a service at 02:42 on the first Saturday of each month:  
   ```ini
   [Timer]
   OnCalendar=Sat *-*-1..7 02:42:00
   Persistent=true
   ```

2. **Monotonic timers** trigger after a set duration from a specific event:  
   | Config | Meaning |
   |--------|---------|
   | `OnBootSec=` | After system boot |
   | `OnStartupSec=` | After service manager starts |
   | `OnActiveSec=` | After unit activation |
   | `OnUnitActiveSec=` | After last activation |
   | `OnUnitInactiveSec=` | After last deactivation |  
   
   Example: Run a service 5 minutes and 20 seconds after the last activation:  
   ```ini
   [Timer]
   OnUnitActiveSec=5min 20sec
   ```

### Managing Timers  

After defining a timer, enable and start it:  
```
systemctl enable myservice.timer  
systemctl start myservice.timer  
systemctl daemon-reload  # Apply changes
```
Check scheduled timers:  
```
systemctl list-timers --all  
```

### Time Shortcuts  

| Shortcut | Runs at |
|----------|--------|
| `hourly` | Start of each hour |
| `daily` | Midnight daily |
| `weekly` | Midnight on Monday |
| `monthly` | Midnight on the 1st |
| `yearly` | Midnight on January 1st |

Example Fedora systemd timer:  
```ini
[Timer]
OnCalendar=daily
RandomizedDelaySec=12h
AccuracySec=20min
Persistent=true
```

### `systemd-run`  

`systemd-run` can start transient services on demand. Examples:  
- Run `helloworld.service` every 2 hours:  
  ```
  systemd-run --on-active="2hours" --unit="helloworld.service"
  ```
- Run a script after 2 hours:  
  ```
  sudo systemd-run --on-active="2hours" /usr/local/bin/helloworld.sh --language=en_US
  ```

For checking timer logs, use:  
```
journalctl -u myservice.timer
```

> Use `--user` with systemd commands to run timers at the user level instead of system-wide.
