# 108.1 Maintain System Time

System administrators must be able to properly maintain system time and synchronize the clock using NTP.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Set the system date and time.
- Set the hardware clock to the correct time in UTC.
- Configure the correct timezone.
- Basic NTP configuration using `ntpd` and `chrony`.
- Knowledge of using the `pool.ntp.org` service.
- Awareness of the `ntpq` command.

## Important Files and Commands

- `/usr/share/zoneinfo/` - Stores timezone data.
- `/etc/timezone` - Specifies system timezone.
- `/etc/localtime` - Symlink to timezone data.
- `/etc/ntp.conf` - NTP daemon configuration.
- `/etc/chrony.conf` - Chrony configuration.
- `date` - Displays or sets system date/time.
- `hwclock` - Manages hardware clock.
- `timedatectl` - Controls system time settings.
- `ntpd` - NTP daemon.
- `ntpdate` - Manually sync time from NTP servers.
- `chronyc` - CLI for Chrony.
- `pool.ntp.org` - Public NTP pool servers.

## System Time vs. Hardware Clock

The system clock is managed by the OS and reset on every reboot, while the hardware clock (RTC) is maintained by the motherboard battery and keeps time when the system is off.

### Check System and Hardware Time

```bash
$ date
Fri Jun 23 13:47:22 +0330 2023

$ sudo hwclock
2023-06-23 13:47:41.160122+03:30
```

### Set System Time

```bash
$ sudo date -s "2024-02-19 10:00:00"
```

### Sync Hardware Clock with System Time

```bash
$ sudo hwclock -w
```

### Set Hardware Clock to UTC

```bash
$ sudo hwclock --systohc --utc
```

## Time Zones

### Check Current Timezone

```bash
$ cat /etc/timezone
Asia/Tehran
```

### Change Timezone

```bash
$ sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York
```

### Verify Timezone Change

```bash
$ date
```

## NTP (Network Time Protocol)

NTP synchronizes system time with internet time servers. The most commonly used service is `pool.ntp.org`.

### Manually Sync Time with NTP

```bash
$ sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org
```

> **Note:** Run `sudo hwclock -w` to save changes.

### Install and Start NTP Daemon (ntpd)

```bash
$ sudo apt install ntp    # Debian/Ubuntu
$ sudo systemctl start ntp
$ sudo systemctl enable ntp
```

### Check NTP Synchronization

```bash
$ ntpq -p
```

## Chrony (Alternative to NTPD)

Chrony is a lightweight NTP alternative, often recommended for modern systems due to better accuracy and faster synchronization.

### Install and Enable Chrony

```bash
$ sudo apt install chrony
$ sudo systemctl start chronyd
$ sudo systemctl enable chronyd
```

### Check Chrony Status

```bash
$ chronyc tracking
$ chronyc sources
```

## Systemd Timesyncd

On some modern distributions, `systemd-timesyncd` may be used instead of NTP or Chrony.

### Check Systemd Timesyncd Status

```bash
$ systemctl status systemd-timesyncd
```

### Enable Systemd Timesyncd

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-timesyncd
```

## Comparison: `ntpd` vs. `chrony` vs. `systemd-timesyncd`

| Feature                | `ntpd` (NTP Daemon) | `chrony` | `systemd-timesyncd` |
|------------------------|--------------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Traditional NTP implementation | Modern NTP alternative with better accuracy | Lightweight NTP client for simple use cases |
| **Accuracy**         | Good, but slow convergence | High, adapts faster | Lower accuracy compared to `chrony` |
| **Best for**         | Long-running servers, networks with stable time sources | Laptops, desktops, VMs, and intermittent connections | Minimal setups, IoT, or containers |
| **Sync Speed**       | Slow to adjust large time drifts | Fast, even with intermittent connectivity | Faster than `ntpd`, but less precise than `chrony` |
| **Network Resilience** | Can be affected by unstable networks | Handles network disconnections well | Basic synchronization only |
| **Hardware Clock Sync** | Yes | Yes, with improved tracking | No direct hardware clock sync |
| **Support for Leap Seconds** | Yes | Yes, better handling than `ntpd` | Limited |
| **Resource Usage**   | Medium | Low | Very low |
| **Firewall Considerations** | Needs UDP 123 open | Needs UDP 123 open | Needs UDP 123 open |
| **Configuration File** | `/etc/ntp.conf` | `/etc/chrony.conf` | `/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf` |
| **Common Commands** | `ntpq -p`, `ntpdate` | `chronyc tracking`, `chronyc sources` | `timedatectl status` |

### **When to Use Each**
- **Use `chrony`** if you need high accuracy, fast synchronization, and a system that frequently changes networks (laptops, VMs, etc.).
- **Use `ntpd`** for traditional server setups that require long-term stability and compatibility.
- **Use `systemd-timesyncd`** for lightweight systems that only need basic time synchronization without an always-running service.

## Summary

- Use `date` and `hwclock` to check/set time.
- Use `timedatectl` to manage timezones.
- Sync manually with `ntpdate` or automatically with `ntpd`, `chrony`, or `systemd-timesyncd`.
- Configure time synchronization via `/etc/ntp.conf` or `/etc/chrony.conf`.
- Prefer `chrony` on modern systems for better performance.
- Ensure firewall rules allow NTP traffic.

By following these steps, you can effectively maintain accurate system time, which is crucial for logs, authentication, and network security.
