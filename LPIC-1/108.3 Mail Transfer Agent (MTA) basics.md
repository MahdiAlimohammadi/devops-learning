# Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) Basics

## Overview
Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) are responsible for handling email transmission between users and servers. This document covers the basics of configuring email aliases, forwarding, and common MTA programs like `postfix`, `sendmail`, and `exim`.

## Key Concepts
- **MTAs**: Programs that handle email sending and receiving.
- **Aliases**: Redirecting emails from one user to another.
- **Forwarding**: Automatically forwarding a user's email to another address.

## Commonly Used MTAs
### 1. **Sendmail**
- One of the oldest MTAs.
- Complex configuration and not very secure.
- Rarely used as the default MTA today.

### 2. **Exim**
- Highly flexible with built-in security features.
- Used mainly in enterprise and security-focused environments.

### 3. **Postfix** (Recommended)
- Modern replacement for Sendmail.
- Easier to configure and widely used in Linux distributions.

> **Note:** Most desktop Linux distributions do not install an MTA by default. If needed, install `postfix` and `mailx` using your package manager.

## Sendmail Emulation Layer
Most MTAs support a `sendmail` compatibility layer to maintain backward compatibility. This means you can use the `sendmail`, `mailq`, and similar commands regardless of which MTA you are using.

## Configuring Email Aliases
Aliases allow redirecting emails from one address to another. These are defined in `/etc/aliases`.

Example:
```text
# Aliases for system accounts
mailer-daemon:  postmaster
postmaster:     root
webmaster:      root
news:           root
```

- In this example, emails sent to `news` will be forwarded to `root`, and `root` is the final recipient.
- After making changes, run:
  ```bash
  newaliases
  ```
  This updates the alias database.

## Sending Emails from the Command Line
You can send an email using the `mail` command:

```bash
echo "This is a test email" | mail -s "Test Subject" user@example.com
```

Or interactively:
```bash
mail user@example.com
Subject: Test Email
Hello, this is a test.
.
Cc:
```

## Forwarding Emails
Users can create a `.forward` file in their home directory to automatically forward all incoming emails to another address.

Example:
```text
user@example.com
```
This forwards all emails received by the user to `user@example.com`.

## Checking the Mail Queue
The `mailq` command lists emails that are queued for delivery.

Example:
```bash
$ mailq
-Queue ID- --Size-- ----Arrival Time---- -Sender/Recipient-------
AA52C228E6B      468 Thu Jan  7 19:59:41  user@example.com
(connect to example.com: Network is unreachable)
                                         user@example.com
```
- Shows queued emails and their status.
- Helps diagnose email delivery issues.

## Summary
- **MTAs**: `postfix` is the recommended option for ease of use and security.
- **Aliases**: Defined in `/etc/aliases` and updated using `newaliases`.
- **Sending Emails**: Use `mail` or scripts for automation.
- **Forwarding Emails**: Set up `.forward` in the user's home directory.
- **Checking Queue**: Use `mailq` to diagnose email delivery issues.

This document provides a foundational understanding of MTAs and their basic configurations for email handling on Linux systems.
